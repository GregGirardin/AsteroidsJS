An Asteroids style game.

Objective

  Shoot as many aliens and asteroids in the three waves.

  A refueling tanker will appear occasionally to replenish resources. Just fly next to it and it will pull you in.
  Iron asteroids can only be destroyed by Black Holes, but you can adjust their velocity with the cannon.

  Big aliens                   100
  Small Attacking aliens       250
  Completing a wave            500 * wave

  Cannon                        -1
  Torpedos                     -10
